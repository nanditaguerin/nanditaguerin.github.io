title: Nostr Event Count
description: Job request to count matching events
---

# Input

Each input MUST be a tag value. Zero or more inputs may be given.

# Output

`content` MUST contain a stringified number representing the final count. DVMs MAY return partial results using kind 7000 in the same format.

# Params

* `relay`: a relay url to include in the count (required, client MAY provide more than one relay)
* `group`: an event field or tag name to group results by, resulting in a potentially nested dictionary of results (optional, client MAY provide more than one group). Supported groups include:
  * `content` - an event's `content` field
  * `pubkey` - an event's `pubkey` field
  * `reply` - an event's `reply` e-tag
  * `root` - an event's `root` e-tag
  * Any other value will be assumed to be a tag name. The first matching tag's value will be used.

# How clients can use this

Clients may want to avoid downloading large datasets from many relays simply in order to de-duplicate and count them. This can be useful for a number of things:

- Counting pubkey followers and other social graph analysis like web of trust score calculation
- Retrieving counts for list pages (number of messages in a conversation, number of lists on a profile)
- Getting metadata for tags (this topic has been used x times)
